    {
      question: "How far can electric vehicles travel on a single charge?",
      answer:
        "Modern EVs typically range from 200-400 miles per charge. Entry-level models like the Nissan Leaf offer about 226 miles, while premium vehicles like the Mercedes EQS can exceed 450 miles. Range continues to improve with advancing battery technology.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to charge an electric vehicle?",
      answer:
        "Charging time varies by method: Level 1 (standard outlet) takes 8-20 hours, Level 2 (240V home charger) takes 4-8 hours, and DC fast charging can add 200+ miles in 30 minutes. Most owners charge overnight at home for daily convenience.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are there enough charging stations?",
      answer:
        "The charging network is rapidly expanding. There are over 60,000 public charging stations in the US, with new ones added daily. Tesla's Supercharger network is opening to other brands, and major retailers are installing charging stations at their locations.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long do EV batteries last?",
      answer:
        "EV batteries typically last 8-15 years or 100,000-200,000 miles. Most manufacturers offer 8-10 year warranties on batteries. Studies show batteries retain 80-90% capacity after 8 years, and battery replacement costs are decreasing rapidly.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do EVs work well in cold weather?",
      answer:
        "EVs do lose some range in cold weather (typically 20-30%), but they start reliably and warm up quickly. Many EVs have battery heating systems and can be preheated while plugged in. Cold weather performance improves with each new generation.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I run out of charge?",
      answer:
        "Most EVs provide multiple low-battery warnings and show nearby charging stations. If you do run out, roadside assistance can provide a mobile charge or tow to a charging station. AAA and most manufacturers offer 24/7 EV roadside assistance.",
